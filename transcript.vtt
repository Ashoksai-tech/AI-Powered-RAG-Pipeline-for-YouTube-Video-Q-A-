00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.200
My goal for today's video is to provide

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.759
you with no BS extremely simple agentic

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.800
AI explanation. I'm going to show you

4
00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.719
some real agentic AI systems along with

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.359
the code. So please stay with me till

6
00:00:12.718 --> 00:00:17.839
the end. We will start with a real life

7
00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:20.719
example of my own company. We have 55

8
00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:23.600
plus people and for these people we want

9
00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:25.679
to build an HR assistant which can

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.760
answer simple questions on policies such

11
00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.399
as how many vacation days do they have

12
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.160
per year or what is the policy on seek

13
00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:36.719
leave and for this all this policy data

14
00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:39.199
you have it available in PDF files you

15
00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.640
can build a retrieval augmented

16
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.040
generation chatboard which can simply

17
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.719
pull the information from this PDF and

18
00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.640
answer these questions.

19
00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:53.679
Now is this an agentic AI? The answer is

20
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.159
no. Anthropic has this document on

21
00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.159
building effective agents and they

22
00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.718
categorize these AI applications into

23
00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.038
two categories workflows and agents.

24
00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.840
This rack based chatboard is actually a

25
00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:09.599
workflow. It is not agentic. Let's

26
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.320
advance this chatboard a bit more and

27
00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:14.478
let's add a support where you can ask

28
00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:17.039
question. Okay, how many leaves do I

29
00:01:14.478 --> 00:01:19.118
have left? Specifically, you know, as an

30
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.159
employee, how many leaves do I have

31
00:01:19.118 --> 00:01:24.000
left? You can also apply for the leaves

32
00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.600
right here. Now, see this is important.

33
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.879
This is not just question and answer.

34
00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:31.039
You are taking actions. So, here you

35
00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:34.239
obviously have access to your policy

36
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.400
data via PDF. But on top of that you

37
00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:40.719
integrated LLM with HR management system

38
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.280
through their APIs where you can not

39
00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:46.399
only pull the leaves for a given

40
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.680
employee you can also apply for a leave.

41
00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.399
Okay. So here it will detect your login.

42
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.118
It will identify whether you are moan

43
00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:59.359
Sharma or Abdul Kadir whoever you you

44
00:01:55.118 --> 00:02:02.239
are and it will take the necessary

45
00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.799
action. Do we call this agentic AI?

46
00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:09.038
Well, the answer is again no. This is

47
00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:12.959
tool augmented chatboard. We want to

48
00:02:09.038 --> 00:02:16.079
advance this further and give it a goal

49
00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.120
such as prepare for Sara's maternity

50
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.840
leave. Now, this requires multi-step

51
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.400
reasoning and multi-turn planning.

52
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.280
Another question, onboard the new intern

53
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.239
joining next Monday. Well, this again

54
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.120
requires multi-step planning. Okay. So,

55
00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:37.120
let's call this a broader goal. It is

56
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.400
not a simple task. It's a complex task

57
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.560
and it requires a multi-step reasoning

58
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.439
first of all and then you come up with a

59
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.560
plan that I need to schedule a welcome

60
00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:50.878
meeting with this intern and you will

61
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.519
actually send the meeting invite via

62
00:02:50.878 --> 00:02:55.759
Outlook or whatever uh calendar system

63
00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.319
that you're using. then you might want

64
00:02:55.759 --> 00:03:00.639
to create interns profile in HR

65
00:02:58.318 --> 00:03:03.518
management system. So now you have

66
00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:06.399
integration uh through your HR

67
00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:10.640
management system APIs where it can go

68
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.640
and create interns profile at every step

69
00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.639
there will be some generation also right

70
00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.318
because you let's say if you want to

71
00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.238
schedule a meeting you need to write

72
00:03:16.318 --> 00:03:20.639
some description on what this meeting is

73
00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.680
about and all of that you can generate

74
00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:27.439
using this LLM that you have then you

75
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.920
want to create a ticket in IT help desk

76
00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:32.799
where you get Wi-Fi credential s the

77
00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:35.919
email, Slack access, etc. for that

78
00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:39.519
particular intern. Again, here you will

79
00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:41.759
have uh LLM's role being played as well

80
00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.640
as you have integration with multiple

81
00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:47.039
tools such as Slack, Outlook, u your

82
00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.759
Wi-Fi system and so on. And then you

83
00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:51.679
want to order a laptop. So you have some

84
00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:54.399
kind of you know inventory management

85
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.840
system or some kind of uh IT support

86
00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.760
desk where you can issue ID card order

87
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.959
laptop and so on. This is agentic AI

88
00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:07.438
folks. It requires multi-step reasoning

89
00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.239
and you have to do multi-step planning

90
00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:13.519
and in each of these steps LLMs will be

91
00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.759
involved along with APIs and tools and

92
00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.639
knowledge and memory and so on. So if

93
00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:21.839
you describe a few characteristics of

94
00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:24.160
agentic AI system then first one is goal

95
00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:26.879
oriented planning you are not giving a

96
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.840
task such as tell me how many leaves I

97
00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:35.319
have left okay two that is a simple task

98
00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:38.399
you are giving here a complex task which

99
00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:40.079
requires reasoning as well as multi-step

100
00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:43.519
planning okay so the first

101
00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:47.039
characteristic is goal oriented planning

102
00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:49.599
second one is multi step reasoning then

103
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.720
autonomous decision making. See this

104
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.520
system will send an email it will send

105
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.639
uh the invite for the meeting. So all of

106
00:04:55.519 --> 00:05:00.719
that it is doing in a autonomous way. It

107
00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.879
is not saying okay go to outlook click

108
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.759
this button. It is actually doing that

109
00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:08.560
work. It is performing actions for you.

110
00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.720
Then it has access to tools. All these

111
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.199
tools okay outlook and HR management

112
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.160
system and so on. knowledge which can be

113
00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.680
a PDF files, database and so on. It will

114
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.360
also have a memory. So when you are

115
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.720
having a conversation, it will have a

116
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.360
context, it will remember things. So

117
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.680
this is agentic chatboard. Okay. And any

118
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.319
AI system that you are building uh which

119
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.120
has uh autonomy, okay, it it has some

120
00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:37.038
kind of agency where it can make certain

121
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.560
decisions and it can take certain

122
00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:42.560
actions on its own. Plus it has

123
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.600
multi-step complex reasoning and

124
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.680
planning. That system is called agentic

125
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.160
AI. If I have to put it in a very simple

126
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.639
definition, agentic AI is an AI system

127
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.240
that can make decisions and take actions

128
00:05:52.639 --> 00:06:01.038
on its own to achieve a goal without

129
00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:03.360
being told exactly what to do at every

130
00:06:01.038 --> 00:06:06.079
step. Here is a table summarizing the

131
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.639
capabilities of all three chatboards.

132
00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:10.560
The rack based chatboard is reactive

133
00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.120
which means more like Q&A. You ask a

134
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.918
question it responds but it doesn't have

135
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.038
tool usage, reasoning etc. The second

136
00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:22.639
one tool augmented chatboard is reactive

137
00:06:19.038 --> 00:06:25.599
and it also has access to tool but it

138
00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:28.918
cannot reason plan and be proactive.

139
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.039
Whereas agentic AI system has all these

140
00:06:28.918 --> 00:06:33.519
characteristics. There are many examples

141
00:06:31.038 --> 00:06:35.519
of agentic AI systems. For example, AI

142
00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:38.478
coding. If you're using lovable or

143
00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:41.758
replet to create a react native app

144
00:06:38.478 --> 00:06:45.199
similar to to-do east okay then see it

145
00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:48.800
will first figure out what kind of

146
00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:51.439
features to-do list has then it will do

147
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.439
see this kind of multi-step planning and

148
00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:58.639
it will then write code execute the code

149
00:06:55.439 --> 00:07:02.399
it will debug it fix issues again write

150
00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:05.439
code execute it and so on okay so AI

151
00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:08.638
coding being done through lovable,

152
00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:11.519
rapit, etc. is an example of an agentic

153
00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:13.038
AI system. The other one is travel

154
00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:15.519
assistant. You might have a travel

155
00:07:13.038 --> 00:07:18.079
assistant where you can say book a 7-day

156
00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:20.560
trip to London in May where where the

157
00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:22.079
weather is sunny for at least 4 days.

158
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.839
This is usually my criteria. You know,

159
00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:26.560
whenever I go anywhere, I want the

160
00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:30.638
weather to be sunny. And you have some

161
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.879
uh budget uh constraints. So now if you

162
00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:35.519
have built agentic AI system, it will

163
00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:38.159
first prepare a plan. You know how

164
00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:40.318
deepsek creates that plan or any other

165
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.319
reasoning model will create a plan. So

166
00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:47.280
it will first create a plan then it will

167
00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:50.639
execute that plan step by step with the

168
00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:52.478
help of all the tools and APIs that you

169
00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:56.000
have integrated. In this particular

170
00:07:52.478 --> 00:07:59.439
system, I might have integrated Acue

171
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.839
weather API for weather, Xedia API for

172
00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:04.800
booking flights and so on. Here is a

173
00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:07.918
small example of agentic AI system where

174
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:10.240
you are writing an agent to assist an

175
00:08:07.918 --> 00:08:13.038
equity research analyst. They usually

176
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.800
write reports on companies. So here you

177
00:08:13.038 --> 00:08:17.598
are giving a goal. You are not giving

178
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:21.120
the exit steps. Okay. Write a report on

179
00:08:17.598 --> 00:08:23.680
Nvidia. You're also giving it access to

180
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:26.240
y finance tool reasoning tools. You can

181
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.639
provide duck duck go search and so on.

182
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.720
And here we are using agno framework.

183
00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:32.399
You can just say pip install agno and

184
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.680
you can run this code. This code is

185
00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:36.799
available in the video description

186
00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:40.958
below. Now when I run this, see here I'm

187
00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:43.918
using gemini as a model here. And what

188
00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:47.518
it will do is it will look at this goal

189
00:08:43.918 --> 00:08:49.600
and it will do multi-step reasoning

190
00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:51.919
planning and then it will execute those

191
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.920
steps. So see here it is doing

192
00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:56.799
reasoning. Okay, I need to gather this

193
00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:58.559
much information. Here is my reasoning.

194
00:08:56.799 --> 00:09:02.319
Then this is the step number two.

195
00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:03.838
Compile a report. Uh you need to perform

196
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.000
all these steps right like getting a

197
00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:08.560
company info, analyst recommendation,

198
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.639
company news. So it is doing all of that

199
00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:13.518
step by step and generating this

200
00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:16.958
comprehensive report which has some key

201
00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:18.639
statistics for that company. Uh analyst

202
00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:20.879
recommendation is one of the common

203
00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:23.600
things you'll find in any uh equity

204
00:09:20.879 --> 00:09:26.320
research report and recent news as well.

205
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.320
I did not say okay have news in the

206
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.879
bottom have analyst recommendation and

207
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.360
so on. It kind of figured it out on its

208
00:09:30.879 --> 00:09:36.320
own. You don't have to always write the

209
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.720
code. You can use low code or no code

210
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.879
tools such as Zapier. Here they are

211
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.040
showing a cloud integration with their

212
00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:44.720
Zapier MCP server and you have connected

213
00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:46.319
all these tools and now you're saying

214
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.959
like what's on my calendar. It will

215
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:52.160
access the uh calendar tool and it will

216
00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:55.119
tell you uh what do you have then you

217
00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:57.759
can have some other task. See here it is

218
00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.240
showing me the calendar items. Then you

219
00:09:57.759 --> 00:10:02.720
can say can you tell me more about this

220
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:07.919
particular thing and it will call the

221
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:12.000
appropriate uh tool and it will tell you

222
00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:14.240
l veo is a CEO at whatever company. Uh

223
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.519
these are simple tasks but you can have

224
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:21.039
complex tasks you can use a reasoning

225
00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:23.839
model and you can uh design your MCP

226
00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:25.759
server such that it can handle those

227
00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:27.360
multi-step reasoning process. The other

228
00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:29.559
tool I want to mention which is similar

229
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.879
to Zapier is

230
00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:36.159
N8N where you can do drag and drop

231
00:10:32.879 --> 00:10:38.559
essentially and see here let's say you

232
00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:40.879
are doing create user form submission

233
00:10:38.559 --> 00:10:44.000
and then it will trigger this AI agent

234
00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:46.799
which has anthropic chat model it has

235
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.839
posgress chat memory it has access to

236
00:10:46.799 --> 00:10:51.278
Jira Microsoft enter ID and so on and

237
00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:53.360
then you can define these kind of

238
00:10:51.278 --> 00:10:56.240
workflows see you can define these kind

239
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:59.759
of workflows and you can create rag

240
00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:03.039
based system or tool augmented system or

241
00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:05.278
even agentic AI. Okay. So agentic for

242
00:11:03.039 --> 00:11:08.319
agentic AI this AI agent piece is going

243
00:11:05.278 --> 00:11:11.919
to be important. The kind of prompt that

244
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:14.320
you write you can make it solve really

245
00:11:11.919 --> 00:11:17.360
complex issues using the reasoning model

246
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.800
such as GPT40. You may have this

247
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.759
question what is the difference between

248
00:11:18.799 --> 00:11:24.240
AI agent and agentic AI? Well, you see

249
00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:28.480
this diagram. This is a diagram of an

250
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:31.120
agentic AI system in an ATN. And any

251
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:34.159
agentic AI system will have one or more

252
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.000
agents. So here you have this one agent.

253
00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:38.759
You can have multiple agents. Okay. But

254
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.320
you need at least one AI agent with that

255
00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:44.078
agentic complex reasoning behavior. The

256
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.120
second question you might have is what

257
00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:52.958
is the difference between Gen AI? Okay,

258
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:55.519
Gen AI versus agentic AI. Well, Genai is

259
00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:58.719
part of agentic AI. So you see this

260
00:11:55.519 --> 00:12:00.560
Google Gemini model. So this model might

261
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.200
generate some text. It might write

262
00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:04.479
email. It might summarize something. It

263
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.560
will have all those generation

264
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.600
capabilities and it is one of the

265
00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:12.638
component in your agentic AI system. All

266
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.720
right. So generative AI is related to

267
00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:17.278
generating new data, text, video, images

268
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.839
and so on. And you can have that as a

269
00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:21.919
subcomponent within your agentic AI

270
00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:23.920
system. If you want to see some real

271
00:12:21.919 --> 00:12:26.240
project examples along with the code for

272
00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:28.399
rag and two augmented AI systems then I

273
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.480
have two different videos. We have given

274
00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:32.759
all the code. See the code for both the

275
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:36.560
projects is here. This is a cold email

276
00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:39.600
generator and the second one is MCP for

277
00:12:36.559 --> 00:12:42.799
that HR le management and also I would

278
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:46.800
suggest you read this building effective

279
00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:49.519
agents guide by anthropic. They have

280
00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:51.199
mentioned various design patterns. So

281
00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:53.200
this is one workflow based design

282
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.759
pattern where let's say you have a

283
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:59.278
chatboard and the question might be

284
00:12:55.759 --> 00:13:01.838
routed to a technical support team or a

285
00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:03.679
sales team or some other team. In that

286
00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:06.560
case you can have LLM as a router and

287
00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:09.120
then individual LLMs each for sales team

288
00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:11.919
technical team and so on. Uh everything

289
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:14.159
is hardwired through code here. So this

290
00:13:11.919 --> 00:13:16.639
is a workflow. There is another example

291
00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:18.879
of a workflow where uh you perform

292
00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:21.919
individual tasks using these LLMs and

293
00:13:18.879 --> 00:13:24.799
then you aggregate them. Okay. Uh here

294
00:13:21.919 --> 00:13:27.278
is another example of orchestrator based

295
00:13:24.799 --> 00:13:30.319
workers. This is also a workflow and

296
00:13:27.278 --> 00:13:31.919
then comes agents. So for agents see

297
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.320
there will be this kind of loop. So

298
00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:36.319
action feedback action feedback you know

299
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.959
multi-step reasoning multi-step

300
00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.200
planning. Folks I hope now it is clear

301
00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:43.439
what exactly is agentic AI. It's just a

302
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.120
jargon. The idea is really simple.

303
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.480
Please check video description for the

304
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.480
code and other resources.
